A.1 Huffman coding
Huffman code is an optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. We
require to implement a parallel application reading an ASCII file, computing the Huffman code and using
the code to write a “compressed” version of the original file. Measures relative to parallelization should
be taken both including and excluding read (write) times of the input (output) file in (from) memory.
